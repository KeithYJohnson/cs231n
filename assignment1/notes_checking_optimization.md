yeah that's right so it's negative log of 1 over number of classes so you
34:57basically be getting all zeros here you get all one's here and so here is one
35:01over the number of classes and then negative log of that ends up being your
35:05final awesome so actually for myself whenever I run optimization I sometimes
35:10take note of my number of classes and I evaluate negative log of 1 over a number
35:13of classes and I'm trying to see what is the my first beginning lost expect and
35:17so when I start the optimization I make sure that i'm getting roughly that
35:19otherwise i know some things maybe slightly off expect to get something on
35:23that order
35:24moreover as I'm optimizing I expect that I go from that to zero and if I'm seeing
35:28negative numbers then I know from the functional form that something very
35:31strange is going on right because he never actually expect to get negative
35:33numbers out of this
